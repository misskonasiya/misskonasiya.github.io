Hi, I am Xavier Cedro of 9 - Campion. I am currently 14 years old as I am typing this in the year 2023. This page is all about the stuff that I like so that you can get to know me better.

This is me and the big bear from vista mall:

I am a gamer who plays a large variety of games. I watch anime and read manga sometimes and I also **love** editing videos. 
I am honestly very quiet if we aren't very close but once we get to know each other then I'll probably get very comfortable and even noisy.


My friends refer to me as their "therapist because of the fact I love to listen to their problems and I give very good advice (most of the time)üëç

**One of my goals in life is to be a professional editor**

I have always found the art of editing a fascinating thing. My friends always ask me to edit some videos for them and I am always happy to do so. I am quite confident in my editing skills and learning more tricks is always a good thing


**Another one of my goals is being a house husband**

![MV5BOWZhZTE1NDAtODQ5Yy00NDQ3LWE5ZDctMTZjZmU5OGFiZWYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzMTI1Mjk3 _V1_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122416352/216597465-6239a9f8-6fa9-4706-b293-6b253c7ee44d.jpg)

I am aware that being a house husband is a hard task but it's a sacrifice I am willing to take for my future wife. I'm lazy sometimes but when I know it's for a good cause then I'm willing to do it as soon as possible.


**The last goal that I am going to share is have enough money to buy lots of cute toys**

This is probably my weirdest goal in life but I want to do it because I feel comfortable with stuffed toys.

**The only sport that I play is soccer or futsal**

![GWSGDGN635JLDB6NOP3VN4OC2U](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122416352/216600041-dc7751a9-7cc5-4951-868c-3462dad8eb9d.jpg)

My father introduced me to this sport when I was very young and it became my daily routine to play it until 2019. I took a break from soccer and physical activity in general and now that Intrams 2022-2023 is coming I took the chance to play the sport again (although I have forgotten most of my tricks already).

**I am currently reading an action manga called Chainsaw man**

![Chainsawman](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122416352/216601022-a9eb771d-d057-4990-a4bb-5ac7d83c342d.jpg)

Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who makes a contract that fuses his body with that of a dog-like devil named Pochita, granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws.

It is a very odd piece of art and it has a lot of gore and some indecent scenes but it is a very interesting and fun manga.

I've realized that happiness is something that comes and  goes. You will never know when it'll go away and when you'll be able to get it back. Which is why you should treasure that feeling while its still there. Spend time with your family, hang out with your friends, strengthen your relationships while they aren't gone yet. I learned this the hard way and am speaking from experience. I used to have this girl in my life. I expected us to be together forever so I neglected the relationship. Something went wrong but I never knew what it was. Now I am healing from that experience. This is why I love helping people with their problems especially in relationships because I have learned too much, gotten wiser and I don't want others to experience the things that I had to go through.

unfortunately I am unable to find any more videos that I have edited that are presentable. This is a video that I edited when I was in grade 8 (2021) hence the low quality, featuring many of my great friends.
